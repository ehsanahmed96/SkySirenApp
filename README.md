# Architecture
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, which separates the user interface (View) from the underlying data (Model) and introduces a ViewModel to handle the business logic and communication between the View and Model. This pattern promotes a clean architecture and facilitates easier testing and maintenance of the codebase.

# Dependencies
The project utilizes the following dependencies:

1- Picasso - Image loading and caching library.

2- Retrofit - Type-safe HTTP client for API requests.

3- Room - Database library for data persistence.

4- WorkManager - Library for managing background tasks, such as weather updates and notifications.
Google Maps API - Enables map functionality and location selection.
5- Lottie: For the splash screen animation.

# Unit Testing
The project includes unit testing for the ViewModel and Repository components. Unit testing is an essential part of software development, as it helps ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
